So, now we have all the information we need, let's get started with the challenge.. After running the downloaded virtual machine in the virtual box, the machine will automatically be assigned an IP address from the network DHCP.. It will be visible on the login screen. The target machine??s IP address can be seen in the following screenshot.. The target machine IP address is 192.168.1.24, and we will be using 192.168.1.25 as the attacker machine IP address wherever required.. Note: the target machine IP address may be different in your case, as the network DHCP assigns it.. We do not need to run the Netdiscover command for this machine to get the target IP address as it is automatically assigned and displayed on the screen.. Now that we have the target machine IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine.. After getting the target machine's IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine. We will use the Nmap tool, as it works effectively and is available by default on Kali Linux. The results can be seen below:. Let's start enumerating the target machine by exploring the HTTP port 8080. We opened the target machine IP address on the browser, which can be seen below:. A web application is running on the target machine, and by the text, we assume it is a banking application.. There is a login form available on the home page.. For this purpose, we used the Dirb tool, which is widely used for web application files and directory enumeration.."

1203,Executing,"However, I will try to explain it in simpler terms. The script generates a payload that can be used to control a remote computer (the target) through a vulnerability called ""meterpreter."" This payload is written in PHP code and can send the attacker information about the target's IP address and port number. Once the payload reaches the target, it disables error reporting, connects to the attacker-controlled server, and executes the malicious code."
1203,Executing,"The goal is to execute code remotely on the target computer. First, the tool sets the remote host to 192.168.1.101 and the URI to ""/cms/"". Then, it starts a reverse TCP handler on the attacker's computer with IP address 192.168.1.109 and port number 4444. Next, a payload is sent to the target computer with the found page parameter ""/cms/index.php?page=index"". The exploit is successful, and a Meterpreter session is opened between the attacker's computer and the target computer on port 4444. The OS of the target computer is identified as ""typhoon.local"" running on Linux with version 3.13.0-32-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 03:54."
