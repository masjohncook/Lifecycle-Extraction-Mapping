So, now we have all the information we need, let's get started with the challenge.. After running the downloaded virtual machine in the virtual box, the machine will automatically be assigned an IP address from the network DHCP.. It will be visible on the login screen. The target machine??s IP address can be seen in the following screenshot.. The target machine IP address is 192.168.1.24, and we will be using 192.168.1.25 as the attacker machine IP address wherever required.. Note: the target machine IP address may be different in your case, as the network DHCP assigns it.. We do not need to run the Netdiscover command for this machine to get the target IP address as it is automatically assigned and displayed on the screen.. Now that we have the target machine IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine.. After getting the target machine's IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine. We will use the Nmap tool, as it works effectively and is available by default on Kali Linux. The results can be seen below:. Let's start enumerating the target machine by exploring the HTTP port 8080. We opened the target machine IP address on the browser, which can be seen below:. A web application is running on the target machine, and by the text, we assume it is a banking application.. There is a login form available on the home page.. For this purpose, we used the Dirb tool, which is widely used for web application files and directory enumeration.."

1203,Executing,"However, I will try to explain it in simpler terms. The script generates a payload that can be used to control a remote computer (the target) through a vulnerability called ""meterpreter."" This payload is written in PHP code and can send the attacker information about the target's IP address and port number. Once the payload reaches the target, it disables error reporting, connects to the attacker-controlled server, and executes the malicious code."
1203,Executing,"The goal is to execute code remotely on the target computer. First, the tool sets the remote host to 192.168.1.101 and the URI to ""/cms/"". Then, it starts a reverse TCP handler on the attacker's computer with IP address 192.168.1.109 and port number 4444. Next, a payload is sent to the target computer with the found page parameter ""/cms/index.php?page=index"". The exploit is successful, and a Meterpreter session is opened between the attacker's computer and the target computer on port 4444. The OS of the target computer is identified as ""typhoon.local"" running on Linux with version 3.13.0-32-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 03:54."

To know more about path variable privilege escalation use this link: <https:/www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-path-variable/>. This content is a series of commands and instructions entered into the terminal of a computer. The first command changes the current directory to ""/tmp"". Then, two echo commands are used to write the output of ""cat /etc/shadow"" to a file called ""ps"" with the number 4 appended to it. After that, the permissions for a file called ""psa"" and another file named ""ps"" are changed to be readable by all users using the command ""chmod 777"". The next two commands change the PATH environment variable to include the directory ""/tmp"" before any other directories. Then, the user navigates to the directory ""/home/user3"" and changes their username to ""GSeroNI"", followed by a command that executes a program called ""MMCHENMUSERS"" with the argument ""cd /home/users<a"". The final two commands navigate to the directory ""/home/user5"" and change the permissions on the ""psa"" file to be readable by all users."
1584,Compromising,"it remember to capture the request in burp suite.. This content appears to be a piece of PHP code that performs an HTTP request using the socker library, which is an alternative to curl. The Accept header indicates that the application can handle text/html and .htmi files, as well as Aliq applications. The Accept-Language header specifies that English language is preferred but other languages may be accepted with a lower priority. The Accept-Encoding header indicates that gzip and deflate compression are supported. The Referer header references a URL on the same server. The Connection header specifies that the connection should be closed after the request is complete."

This content is about configuring connection settings, specifically proxies, to access the internet. The first option is ""No proxy,"" which means no intermediary server is used. The second option is ""Auto-detect proxy settings for this network,"" which automatically detects and uses the proxy server available on the current network. Manual configuration of a proxy server is also possible. Users can choose a specific IP address and port number to use as their proxy server, along with other options like SSL or SOCKS protocols. Some websites may not be accessible through proxies, such as localhost or 127.0.0.1. There is an example of a website that can be accessed through a proxy, like mozilla.org, and specific IP addresses or networks that can be accessed, like 192.168.1.0/24."
